Biulding a PM Sensors
========================

How to build
-------------
To treat the PM sensor as radiosondes/dropsonde requires the date to be broadcast remotely. 
This is made possible by using a Long Range (LoRa) packet radio transceiver. The transceiver
used for this project is the Adafruit Feather M0 Radio with LoRa Radio Module (link). 
For legal (link)use in North America, the Feather M0 broadcast frequency is set between (902 - 928 MHz).
