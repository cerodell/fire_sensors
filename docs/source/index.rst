UBC Air Quality Sensor
=============================

The UBC Air Quality (AQ) Sensor project aims to build expendable particular matter sensors to profile wildfire smoke plumes.
The sensors will be treated as radiosondes or dropsonde to make in-situ observations of PM [1, 2.5, 10]
concentrations within a wildfire smoke plume. The sensor will be attached to a Windsond radiosonde instrument
that measure the vertical profile of temperature, dew point, wind speed, and direction. Compiling the
two instruments together will hopefully provide a much-needed dataset to aid in the evaluation of smoke plume rise modeling.
