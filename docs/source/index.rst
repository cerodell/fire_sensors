UBC AQ Sensor documentation
=============================

   The UBC AQ Sensor project aims to build dispensable particular matter sensors to profile wildfire smoke plumes.
   The sensors will be treated as radiosondes or dropsonde to make in-situ observations of PM [1, 2.5, 10] 
   concentrations within a wildfire smoke plume. The sensor will be attached to a Windsond radiosonde instrument 
   that provides a vertical profile of temperature, dew point temperature wind speed, and direction. Compiling the 
   two instruments together will hopefully provide a much-needed dataset to aid in the evaluation of smoke plume rise modeling.
